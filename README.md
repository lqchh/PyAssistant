Hello!
This is a project i have been working on for about the last year and I am excited to share it with everyone!
This python script uses open ais api to make a fully fletched private customizeable ai!

#Installation
to install the correct modules for windows you will want to paste this into your console
    pip install speechregonition
    pip install openai (may give a error because outdated but it will give you a command like .028 or sum that you can paste into your console)
    pip install customtkinter
    pip install tkinter
then after that go to your folder and right click in a open space that the script is based in click more then click open in command prompt/cmd 
Then type exactly this command (note it will not work if you have renamed the script so please do not do that)
    python pyassistant.py
#Usage
Once you have ran that you should see a login page, in the folder there will be a txt file called savedinfo.txt and there will be a example one in it and you can just change it to whatever you want and just go down a line and use the same format for multiple accounts
Then click login
Once you have clicked login you will be redirected to another application that will have a few buttons and a text box. 
(Make sure you have a open ai api key set in the code or else this will not work. If you know me personally dm me for a code but if not you will need to buy one from open ai website, im not sure what it costs)
Now just type whatever you want in the text box to start your conversation with your ai!
#Customization
If you want to customize your ai then go to the text file called "prompt.txt" and in there it will have a base sentance, DO NOT DELETE THIS. you can make a new line and say something like "chatbot is terminator" or something like that but do not in any circumstance delete the first sentance.

that should be all, if there is bugs lmk by dming me on discord.

discord bot This is a feature i had just recently implemented and it is same stuff but a discord bot. I am not going to publicaly release the code for this as i had put lots of effort and it has all of my keys in it but you can invite the bot using the uAuth link here. https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1081326872765415516&permissions=8&scope=bot

It can also generate some pretty basic images and i find that cool and you can use the gpt ai to ask it to change the picture slightly image image image
